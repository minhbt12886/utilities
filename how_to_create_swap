How to Increase Virtual Memory in Linux
Create a swap file of the size decided upon earlier with the command 
"sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/swapfile bs=1M count=1024" where 1024 
is the size of the swap file in megabytes and the full name of the swapfile is /mnt/swapfil
Format the swap file with the command "sudo mkswap /mnt/swapfile."
Enable the swap file with the command "sudo swapon /mnt/swapfile."
Edit the /etc/fstab file and add the following line in /etc/fstab 
to make the swap file persistent between reboots "/mnt/swapfile none swap sw 00."
