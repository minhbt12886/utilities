Here are a few options:

1) Prefix your grep command with LC_ALL=C to use the C locale instead of UTF-8.

2) Use fgrep because you're searching for a fixed string, not a regular expression.

3) Remove the -i option, if you don't need it.

So your command becomes:

LC_ALL=C fgrep -A 5 -B 5 'db_pd.Clients' eightygigsfile.sql
It will also be faster if you copy your file to RAM disk.
